    # Shriram Khandbahale

    Hello 👋 <br />
    My name is Shriram Khandbahale, currently I'm in my junior year of Engineering
    majoring in Computer Science. About me - I am a curious learner and I love tinkering
    with different stuff and trying to understand how everything works. I’m deeply passionate about
    Science and Technology, I believe they hold the greatest potential to truly transform our lives and advance humanity.
    I aspire to pursue a career in research in future and hopefully contribute something meaningful and impactful.
    There are many things that capture my interest, and this site features some of them. I also plan to publish detailed
    and well-researched [articles](/articles) that dive deep into various technical topics on this website.

    ## Technology and Innovation

    I consider myself very lucky ad grateful to have had an exposure to technology very early in my life, as long as I remember since I was a kid I was surrounded by computers and electronics, which of course made me naturally curious to understand how they work and what they can do. Back then I was more interested in what technology can do for me to make life more fun rather than the core physics or mathematical concepts behind it. It would come later when I got more into the science behind it.

    I used to love building things that solve actual real world problems using technology. Growing up being surrounded by the ecosystem naturally sparked the innovator sprit inside me. Being associated with Digital Impact Square (DISQ) and working closely with multiple startups really changed my perspective towards everything I do. I now try to seek impact in anything I decide to put my time into.

    ## Filmmaking

    During the pandemic when I was in my 10th grade, I started posting videos on YouTube of me teaching Maths and Science concepts,

    here's an embarrassing demo: [Me explaining what is a CPU](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14NkhWJErP8cARp9ibhuW2UFuT2myza0k/view)

    that was when I developed a new hobby of making videos. I used to love the process of shooting and editing videos, So much that I literally got consumed, I stated learning about film production - cinematography, editing, color grading, sound design etc. I used to spend hours learning about these topics from YouTube and other platforms. We used to have a family movie night every saturday, and I loved movies. I decided this is what I want to do.

    There were no direct (formal) entry options directly after 10th, you have to have at least completed your 12th to pursue a formal bachelors. I was never interested in competitive stuff so I opted for a Computer Science Diploma after my 10th as I also had passion for tech with a thought that I'll switch streams after the diploma also satisfying the criteria.

    During the period, whenever I would get the opportunity I would make something, be it for personal project showreels, events I'm organizing, podcasts, or just freelancing sometimes. [here's a logo reveal motion graphic I created for a startup during at DISQ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nikhildrajput_logo-reveal-activity-7086214936296591361-J3Nl)

    However, post diploma I got slipped into Engineering, there were many factors surrounding it, I'd gotten more into tech during my diploma and giving it a broader thought, <mark>Science is the only true predictive model about the universe, everything else is just a human created framework. Technology has constantly advanced humanity, not that there's any absolute need for it, we'd still be able to live normally, close to the nature like other species, without any of the inventions humankind has ever created. But hey, thats the thrill of it right! Exploring the potential of what human intelligence can achieve.</mark>
    And I stepped into Engineering with the thought that I'll study and be able to contribute more meaningfully with this one life that I've got. I know it sounds too philosophical, thats why I sometimes wonder if theres any meaning to it all and should we just have fun and do whatever we enjoy doing at the moment.

    Sorry for that lecture, I get distracted sometimes.

    But I know I'll somehow combine both of my passions in future, [WDI](https://sites.disney.com/waltdisneyimagineering) I'm looking at you. I still love filmmaking, although I haven't worked on anything since a long time, so I'm planning to make a short documentary film about cycling for fun as soon as these EXAMS get over.

    ## Cycling

    I inherited the love for cycling from my father, he's been a passionate cyclist his entire life, he used to take me on rides since I was a kid. Cycle was the primary mode of commute for me everywhere since primary school and as a result I developed a strong endurance. We recently, me and my father went on the Astavinayak tour ~1000km during Ganpati season, It was an amazing experience. But that's for another time.

    I recently got my very first road bike which I love to death and I'm regularly training with an aspiration to enter professional cycling. I recently participated in a local race event, you can read about it here: [My First Ever Cycling Race Experience](/blogs/my-first-ever-cycling-race-experience)

    ## Other things

    I wouldn't call myself an avid reader but I've started to read more often these days, with the Harari's Sapiens series and Walter Isaacson's biographies being my favorites.

    I used to do Gymnastics before but had to quit due to the gap in practice that occurred during the pandemic. Then I got into swimming later, I don't practice regularly for competitions as before but I do go swim on weekends sometimes. I think I'm pretty much a packaged deal for triathlon, I'm thinking of doing Ironman next year, let's see how that goes.

    What else, yes music. I play a classic folk instrument called [Pakhavaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakhavaj) but I don't know if I could mention it now as I only occasionally practice it these days. But I love listening to music, it comes form the sound design aspect of filmmaking I guess. I enjoy listening to instrumental music. I wish I'd known more instruments, Flute is one of my favorite and I'll pretty soon get my hands on a piano probably

    _Finally, here's me doing a backflip with my friend as an outro._
