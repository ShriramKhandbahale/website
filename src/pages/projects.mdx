    Here's a list of some of the projects I've worked on, I mostly work on my internship projects which of course I cannot share here, but here are some of the more personal ones that I've either shipped or worked on late nights.
    
    ## Paithani Saree Traceability System:

    Paithani Saree is one of India's cultural symbol. In effort preserve the tradition of authentic silk Paithani weaving and providing artisans recognition they deserve just like how a artist signs his painting, with an 8-member team of students from college, we developed a complete end-to-end blockchain based traceability system that tracks and showcases the Paithani's entire journey from thread to fabric.

    In collaboration with India’s largest Paithani manufacturer, Kapse Paithani. The project aimed at highlighting the craft of Paithani weaving and the untold stories of skilled hands & creative hearts who bring tradition, innovation, and beauty to life. while also ensuring authenticity and transparency through blockchain. The project was also recognized by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi.

    ## Bookies ERP System:

    The Bookies Club or originally known as Mumbai Bookies (with chapters expending to multiple cities) is India's largest reading community. An initiative by [Shantanu Naidu](https://in.linkedin.com/in/shantanu-naidu), [Gargi Sandu](https://in.linkedin.com/in/gargi-sandu-a10b87a4), [Pritesh Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pritesh-/) and team, with the aim of promoting and reviving the habit of reading in today's busy world. As part of my small contribution to this wonderful initiative, I developed a small lightweight ERP system to automate and streamline all the administrative tasks such as Bulk Emailing, Attendance tracking through QR based IDs, Member registration and management, Achievements tracking, etc.
